# FutureScope AI Context

## Product Visualisation

You are my tech and business co-founder. We are trying to build a competitor to EdTex's Skynet, an ERP B2B SaaS platform for placement automation and student career management.

Our platform's USP is doing everything that Skynet does but better and more automated using our AI agent fleet. Lets research our competitors and understand the below context about the features we are planning. Then we can begin the actual session.

```md
Student Portal
"An AI-driven career companion that deeply understands each student—digging into their journey, refining their aspirations, and strategically optimizing their placement preparation to maximize shortlisting chances and career success."
This captures the essence of profiling, goal-setting, CV building, preparation guidance, and strategic PPT participation—all working together to align students with the best career opportunities.

"Unlike ChatGPT or traditional AI chat models that passively respond to user prompts, this AI agent takes the driving seat—operating with a clear objective in mind. It doesn’t wait for students to ask the right questions; instead, it proactively digs deep, uncovers insights, and guides students step by step toward their ideal career path. With pre-fitted prompts and goal-driven intelligence, it dynamically generates questions, refines responses, and adapts strategies—ensuring that both students and admins achieve their placement objectives seamlessly."

Feature 1: AI-Powered Student Profiling System (dont let them know its an interview - ask them to speak true things only - scare them out )
The AI-powered student profiling system transforms the traditional form-based data collection process into an interactive, voice-enabled experience. Instead of filling out static forms, students engage with an AI agent who conducts an open-ended, conversational interview to extract their complete academic, professional, and extracurricular journey.
How It Works:
Pre-Profile Data Collection: Before starting the conversation, the AI agent prompts students to provide optional inputs like a LinkedIn URL, portfolio website, or resume (1-pager, 2-pager, etc.). These documents are not used directly for flowchart generation but serve as a context in case the student misses mentioning something important during the interview.
Conversational AI-Driven Profiling:
The AI agent starts with an open-ended question like “Tell me about yourself.”
It supports voice-enabled, code-mixed responses, allowing students to speak naturally in any language.
AI dynamically asks follow-up questions based on responses, ensuring that no significant experience or achievement is overlooked.
Real-Time Virtual Flowchart Generation: (DRAW MY LIFE)
As students describe their journey, a visual timeline/flowchart is created dynamically.
Timeline Gap Filling: This helps students identify gaps (e.g., realizing they forgot to mention an important project or experience).

Feature 2: AI-Driven Dynamic Goal Setting
1️⃣ Clarity Assessment
AI uses indirect persona-based questions to determine whether a student is clear or undecided about their career goals.
Students are classified into three categories:
✅ Uninformed → AI conducts an additional analysis to understand career preferences. Educate them.
✅ Domain Confusion → Guided exploration with domain comparisons - with his contextual profile ref. Make them relate to a domain.
 Create a storyline about the diff in domains
✅ Clear on career goals → Move directly to Domain Selection & Smart Roadmap. Move them along.


2️⃣ Deep Profiling for Uninformed Students
AI asks contextual follow-up questions (without bein 
✅ Financial constraints – Do they have an education loan? Any family debt?
✅ Long-term stability – Any history of frequent job switches?
✅ Lifestyle preferences – Work-life balance vs. high compensation trade-offs.
✅ Generalist vs. Specialist – Does the student thrive in a specific skill set or prefer exploring multiple domains?
AI analyses patterns from responses and suggests a suitable career domain that aligns with their priorities.
3️⃣ Domain Selection & Smart Roadmap
Once a domain is chosen (either self-selected or AI-recommended), AI provides a personalized roadmap:
✅ Resources: Articles, PDFs, and video tutorials.
✅ Networking: Suggested seniors/mentors with LinkedIn profiles.
✅ Time Investment Guide: How to reach your chosen domain along with the estimated effort required.
 Context-Aware Random number generator for now for effort estimation.
✅ Shortlist Probability: AI predicts chances of getting shortlisted based on past placement data.
Students can select a secondary domain as a backup in case they don’t get shortlisted in their primary choice. (How is primary and secondary domain decided?)
AI generates a combined roadmap integrating preparation for both domains, ensuring an optimized plan without redundancy.

Feature 3: AI-Powered CV Maker
1️⃣ Resume Generation Based on AI Profiling & Goal Setting
AI generates one or two master resumes based on the primary and secondary domains chosen by the student.
Ensures alignment with institute guidelines (e.g., STAR framework, structured bullet points, domain-specific power verbs).
Strategic structuring: AI optimizes point arrangement to make the resume impactful and ATS-friendly.
2️⃣ AI-Driven Resume Domain Detail Gap Filling
If AI detects missing key experiences or weak domain alignment, it proactively asks follow-up questions to uncover hidden skills.
Example: If a student selects Finance as a secondary domain but lacks sufficient resume points, AI might ask:
✅ “Have you done any financial modeling while working on software development?”
✅ “Did your project involve budgeting, pricing strategies, or ROI analysis?”
AI digs deeper into the student's past work and experiences, ensuring every relevant domain-specific detail is captured. 
Goal: Maximize profile relevance and completeness for better shortlisting chances.
3️⃣ Customization, Editing and Impact Enhancement
Add new points manually which AI can then optionally improve.
AI suggests improvements but allows students to manually edit points.
Add Context: Students can give additional context to create/refine a point.
Provides real-time feedback on phrasing, impact, and relevance.
4️⃣ CV Verification & Automated Email Drafting
Once finalized, AI enables easy CV verification:
✅ Auto-generates a contextual email summarizing key resume points.
✅ Students can copy and send the email to relevant stakeholders for validation.
✅ Validation will either be contextual or exact based on requirement

### 4. Feedback & Feasibility

1. **Completeness & Clarity**  
   - Your breakdown of Systems vs. Data vs. Agents is clear and logical. Each feature uses a subset of these components, which keeps the architecture modular.  
   - The approach of “AI Agents” layering on top of standard “Systems” ensures you can swap or upgrade the AI logic independently.  

2. **Feasibility**  
   - **Technical**:  
     - Most of the Systems (State Manager, Email/Push, etc.) are well-established patterns in modern web apps.  
     - The Agents (Student Profiler, Career Guide, etc.) can be built using standard NLP techniques plus LLMs (e.g., GPT-style) for summarization, question generation, and data extraction.  
     - Multi-language Transcription is also feasible via off-the-shelf speech-to-text APIs.  
   - **Operational**:  
     - You’ll need robust user management (authentication, authorization) to ensure each agent and system interacts safely with user data.  
     - Data privacy considerations (especially with resume parsing, personal data, and recorded interviews) should be addressed early.  

3. **Potential Gaps / Areas to Clarify**  
   - **User/Role Management**: While you mention an Admin Portal, it might help to explicitly define how user accounts and permissions (students, admins, companies) are handled.  
   - **Offer/Placement Tracking**: You have “Job Listings” and “Events,” but you might want a dedicated “Offer” or “Placement Record” entity for Day 0–2 final outcomes (and to feed the Risk Calculation agent).  
   - **Analytics & Reporting**: You have a “Risk Calculation” agent, but you may also want an “Analytics Dashboard” or “Placement Metrics” system for advanced reporting (cohort-level success rates, domain-wise breakdowns).  
   - **Integration with External APIs**: For tasks like LinkedIn scraping or verifying company data, consider how to handle external API integration, rate limits, etc.  

Overall, your solution is already quite comprehensive. The modular approach (Systems, Data, Agents) and the feature-to-component mapping make it straightforward to see how each piece fits. By addressing the few potential gaps (especially user management, offer tracking, and deeper analytics), you’ll have a solid foundation for an end-to-end placement automation platform.
