### Hybrid Team

- **Composition:**  
  - Core: 2 Junior Full-Stack, 1 Junior ML
  - Part-time/Interns: 2 engineering students
- **Monthly Costs:**  
  - Core: ₹80K
  - Interns: 2 × ₹8K = **₹16K**
  - **Total: ₹96K/month**
- **Annual: ₹11.52L**

## Total Annual Cost Projections

| **Category**       | **Lean**    | **Balanced** | **Aggressive** | **Hybrid**  |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Team**           | ₹9.6L       | ₹12.6L       | ₹19.2L         | ₹11.52L     |
| **Infrastructure** | ₹1.92L      | ₹1.92L       | ₹1.92L         | ₹1.92L      |
| **AI Agents**      | ₹0.6L       | ₹0.6L        | ₹0.6L          | ₹0.6L       |
| **Total**          | **₹12.12L** | **₹15.12L**  | **₹21.72L**    | **₹14.04L** |

## Cost-Saving Strategies

- **Team:**
  - Hire fresh graduates and junior developers
  - Offer equity compensation (5-10%) to offset lower salaries
  - Leverage engineering interns for support tasks
  - Remote work to save office costs

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Use AWS free tier maximally
  - Self-host open-source alternatives
  - Implement aggressive auto-scaling
  - Use student/startup credits from cloud providers

- **Development:**
  - Focus on MVP features only
  - Use open-source LLMs and tools
  - Maximize use of existing libraries
  - Build with scalability in mind but implement minimally

## Key Assumptions

- Team members accept lower initial salaries for equity
- Heavy use of open-source alternatives
- Initial feature set focused on core functionality
- Remote-first approach to save costs

## Conclusion

The bootstrapped approach with the **Hybrid Team** model (₹14.04L annually) offers the most balanced path forward. This structure provides necessary technical capability while maintaining minimal burn rate, making it feasible to sustain through initial customer revenues and small seed investments.

This model assumes team members are willing to work at lower salaries for equity, and relies heavily on fresh talent and open-source solutions. While challenging, this approach is realistic for an early-stage startup and provides runway for 12-18 months with minimal initial investment.
